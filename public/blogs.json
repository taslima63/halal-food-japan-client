        "question": "When to use Node and Mongodb?",
        "answer": "'node.js is especially suited for applications that require persistent connection from the browser back to the server. - such as chat programs, or interactive games' If one is just building an application that does not necessarily need user/server communication, developing with other frameworks would be just fine and will take much less time. MongoDB is more suited in scenarios that call for reading/writing a lot of data, without much emphasis on transaction safety (if some data occasionally gets lost in a server crash, it's not a big deal), expect to scale big, and don't really have a stable schema.",
